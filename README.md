Strongly Connected Components


### Introduction

A Graph is considered strongly connected if every vertex in the graph can be reached from every other vertex. An 
 arbitrary directed graph may have strongly connected components, which are defined as partitions of subgraphs that are
 themselves strongly connected.

In other words, a directed graph is strongly connected if there is a path between all pairs of vertices and strongly 
 connected component (SCC) of a directed graph is a maximal strongly connected subgraph.

It is possible to check the strong connectivity of a graph and to compute the strongly connected components of a 
 directed graph in linear time. We present three fundamental algorithms in graph theory that are connected to this 
 topic: Kosaraju's algorithm (also known as the Kosaraju-Sharir algorithm), Tarjanâ€™s algorithm, and Gabow's path-based 
 algorithm.
